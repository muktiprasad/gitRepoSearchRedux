Notes:
I have added the functionality, using react functional component using hooks.
I have incorporated the redux as well.

I have not done data persist in this scope, but that can be done using
redux persist / server call to get things updated.

There is a validation I have added for the textbox, if search text is
 not given

I have created a dropdown component, Result component, Search component,
 Loader component, Product thumbnail component to show git repos in result 
 container.

I have added few unit tests in App.test.js file

I have created a CSS file named ProductThumbnail.CSS

I have added a gif for progress indicator.

To Run application:

Just do a npm i , and then npm start. For testing use npm test.
